        data rather than replacing them.\n</string>
    <string name="UCItraining">Training:\n\tTraining is done by first shuffling the pre-processed data and seperating it into 50-25-25.
        50 percent of our data is being used for training, 25 percent is being used for testing, and 25 percent is being used for validation to prevent overfitting.
        The hidden layer has been set to 15 for this run as it has gotten the lowest error from testing. The activation function used was the logistic
        function which is the sigmoid function.</string>
